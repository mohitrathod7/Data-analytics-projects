Geographic Distribution of Listings: The project maps the number of listings by Zip code across Calgary and surrounding areas, showing concentrations of listings in various communities.

Market Share of Realty Firms: It analyzes the market share of different realty firms, with "Others with less than 1% individual contribution" making up the largest share (23.35%).

Listing Distribution by Price Range: The data categorizes listings by price ranges (e.g., Between 500K to 1M, Less than 500K, Between 1M to 2M), showing the number of listings and average price per square foot for each category. For instance, 2,053 listings are between $500K and $1M, with an average price of $692.2K.

Number of Listings by Place: The project identifies places with the highest number of listings, with Beltline having the most (155 listings).

Most Expensive and Affordable Places: It highlights the 10 most expensive places (e.g., Bel-Aire with an average listing price of $3.95M) and the 10 most affordable places (e.g., Foothills with an average listing price of $293.90K) based on average listing price.

Places with Highest and Lowest Average Price per SqFt: The analysis also looks at average price per square foot, identifying Foothills ($2,028.31/SqFt) as having the highest and Brae Glen West ($198.35/SqFt) as having the lowest among the top/bottom 10.

Unit Types by Number of Beds and Baths: The project includes a matrix showing the distribution of unit types based on the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, along with a stacked bar chart illustrating unit types by bedroom type. For example, 324 units have 1 bath and 1 bed, making up 9.64% of total units.

Million Dollar Club: It identifies and lists "Places with over average $1M value," providing their average listing price and the number of listings in each of those places.
